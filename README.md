2. Hosting and Deployment 
To make the project accessible, it must be hosted live on a suitable platform. Below are the 
rules for deployment:
a. Hosting Platforms 
 Use GitHub Pages for static frontend applications. 
 Use Render, Netlify, or Vercel for full-stack applications. 
 Ensure backend services (if applicable) are hosted and accessible via public endpoints 
(e.g., Render, Railway, or AWS). 
b. Deployment Steps 
 Include clear instructions in the documentation on how to deploy the project on the 
chosen platform. 
 Share the live project URL prominently in the README.md. 
c. Demo Video 
 Create a short demo video (2–5 minutes) showcasing the live project and its key 
functionalities. 
 Upload the video to YouTube and include the link in the documentation.

4. Code Repository and GitHub Rules 
Every project must follow these GitHub-related rules: 
a. Repository Setup 
 Push all code to a GitHub repository. 
 The repository name should follow the format: 
<team_name>_<problem_statement_title> 
Example: TeamAlpha_ResumeBuilderJobPortal. 
 Add a detailed description and tags to the repository. 
b. Branching and Version Control 
 Use branches for development:  
o main: Stable, production-ready code. 
o dev: Features under development. 
o Additional branches for each feature/module (e.g., feature/resume
builder). 
 Use proper commit messages:  
o Bad: Update code 
o Good: Add job search filters based on location and skills 
c. README.md 
 Ensure the README.md is complete and well-formatted. 
 Use markdown styling (e.g., headers, bullet points, code blocks). 
d. GitHub Workflow 
 Follow proper pull request and code review processes if working in a team. 
 Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and feature requests. 
e. Public Access 
 Make the repository public before the submission deadline. 

5. Submission Guidelines 
 Submit the following:  
1. GitHub Repository Link: Ensure it contains all code, documentation, and 
resources. 
2. Live Project Link: The hosted version of the project. 
3. Demo Video Link: A video walkthrough of the project. 
4. Team Details: Names, email IDs, and roles of all team members. 
 Use the provided submission form or platform to upload these details.

6. General Rules 
 Originality: Ensure the project is original and built during the hackathon/webathon 
duration. 
 Time Management: Complete the project within the allocated timeframe. 
 Team Collaboration: Work collaboratively, ensuring all members contribute. 
 No Plagiarism: Any instance of plagiarism will lead to disqualification.
